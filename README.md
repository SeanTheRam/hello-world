# hello-world

Hello!

I'm Sean, and I am a budding student of software development, aiming to learn programming through self-study. I have yet to commit to learning my first programming language, but as of the moment, I am torn between learning Java and Python. I'd be glad to hear your suggestions regarding this matter.
